# Project Name: Forecasting Mutual Fund Returns in Israel

## Description:
This project aims to forecast mutual fund returns in Israel using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on analyzing historical data from 2019 and developing models and methods to predict the future performance of mutual funds. The project team conducted extensive research and analysis to achieve accurate forecasting results.

## Project Structure:
The project is divided into two main components Descriptive Statistics and the Forecasting of  mutual funds yield.

## Descriptive Statistics Jupyter Notebook:
-   File Name: descriptive_statistics.ipynb
-  Description: This notebook contains the code and analysis for performing descriptive statistics on the dataset. It provides a deeper understanding of the data by statistically describing significant parameters in a quantitative and visual way. The notebook includes various statistical measures, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and data visualization techniques.

## Forecasting mutual funds yield Jupyter Notebook:
- File Name: Forecasting_mutual_funds_yield_final2.ipynb
-  Description: The  notebook focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models for forecasting mutual fund returns. It includes the following key sections:

### Data Preprocessing:

The notebook begins with data preprocessing steps, where the dataset is cleaned and transformed into a suitable format for analysis.
Data cleaning techniques including handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.
Feature engineering - we created the feautres:
-  MVCF: Monthly  asset value change rate
-  YVCF: Yearly asset value change rate
-  MCFA: Monthly change in fund assets rate
-  YCFA: Yearly change in fund assets rate
-  yearly yield
-  monthly yield
- Model Training:
### Model Training:
This section focuses on training machine learning models to predict the continuous and numerical value of fund yield.
methodologies include:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- XGBoost Regression

### assessment of accuracy and performance of the trained models:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R2)
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Cross-Validation
- Residual Analysis

### Interpretation and Analysis:

After training and evaluating the models, the notebook provides interpretations and analysis of the forecasting results. it explores the significance of the different features and their impact on the predicted fund yield on monthly and yearly rate.
